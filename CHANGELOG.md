# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Status Bar are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.0.3] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Reworked how the icon appears on desktop-app launch. The app is now started by the existing session hook (which fires when the Claude desktop app opens, when `claude` runs in a terminal, or when a conversation is opened) and quits itself when Claude is closed and no session is active. This keeps the "icon appears when the desktop app opens" behavior from 0.0.2 with no background helper.

### Removed
- The background watcher (a `launchd` LaunchAgent running a shell script) introduced in 0.0.2. It showed up as a "bash" item under Login Items and Extensions, which was confusing. There is no longer any login item or background item. Upgrading from 0.0.2 removes the old LaunchAgent automatically.

### Fixed
- The menu bar icon now reliably disappears when you quit the Claude desktop app, detected directly rather than relying on the session-end hook (which is unreliable during app shutdown).
- Upgrades now self-heal: the app re-runs its installer when the version changes, so updating from an older version refreshes the hooks and removes the old background watcher without any manual step. Previously the installer only ran on a first-ever install.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Desktop app watcher: the menu bar icon now appears the moment the Claude desktop app opens, before you start a conversation, and disappears shortly after you quit it. Previously the icon only showed once a session began. Implemented as a lightweight `launchd` LaunchAgent that tracks the Claude desktop process (installed via `install.js`, removed via `uninstall.js`).

### Changed
- Ending a Claude Code session no longer hides the icon while the Claude desktop app is still open.

### Fixed
- Uninstall now removes all of the app's own hooks, including the `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` lifecycle hooks that a previous version left behind. It only ever touches this app's hooks, never any others.

### Notes
- The desktop watcher is part of the DMG / standalone install path. The Claude Code plugin install path keeps the session-only behavior.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Initial release: macOS menu bar status indicator for Claude Code, driven entirely by Claude Code hooks.
- Animated Claude spark, elapsed turn timer, and an "awaiting permission" dot.
- Two animation styles (Claude, Claude Code) and two color modes (Orange, System), persisted in preferences.
- Refcounted session lifecycle: launches when Claude Code opens, quits when the last session ends.
- Signed and notarized DMG so it opens without a Gatekeeper warning.
- Claude Code plugin marketplace manifest for the plugin install path.
