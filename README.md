## vibego

A tiny macOS menu bar app that shows **Claude Code's live status**: an animated Claude icon while it's thinking or running a tool, a yellow dot when it's awaiting your permission, and the elapsed time of the current turn. Lightweight, no window, no dock icon, no usage dashboards.

> Built so you can tab away during a long "thinking" stretch and still see, at a glance, whether Claude is working, waiting on you, or done._

## What it shows

- **Thinking / working** — the icon animates, with a live `1m 1s` timer.
- **Running a tool** — a short label (`Editing`, `Reading`, `Running command`, `Using tool`, …).
- **Awaiting permission** — a paused yellow dot, in both the CLI and the Desktop app.
- **Idle / done** — rests on the Claude logo.
- **Codex support** — installs Codex hooks too, tracks Codex turns from `~/.codex/statusbar/state.json`, and shows Codex when it is the most recently active agent.
- **Codex limits** — a second menu-bar icon shows two vertical 5-block meters: the left column is the 5-hour window remaining, the right column is the 7-day window remaining. Click it for plan, context, reset, and update details.

Everything is controlled from the menu:

- **Show timer:** toggle the elapsed `1m 1s` clock.
- **Play completion sound:** a soft chime when a turn longer than a minute finishes (off by default).
- **Animation style:**
  - **Claude Spark**, the web/chat "morph" spark
  - **Claude Code**, the terminal glyph spinner
  - **Crab Walking**, a pixel-art Clawd crab that scuttles while Claude works
- **Icon color:** **Orange** or **System** (adaptive black/white). The Claude and Claude Code styles follow this setting; Crab Walking is always its orange pixel-art self.
- **Version and update:** the menu shows your current version, with a one-click "Update available" when a newer release exists.

## Where it works

| Surface | Tracked? |
|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI (terminal) | ✅ |
| Claude Code Desktop — **Code** tab | ✅ |
| Cursor (Claude Code extension) | ✅ |
| Claude Desktop — **Chat** tab | ❌ |
| **Cowork** | ❌ |
| Codex CLI / app hooks | ✅ |

## Requirements

- macOS 12+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (CLI or the Desktop app)
- Node.js

## Install

### Option A — DMG (recommended) 

Signed and notarized. Open it, drag the app to Applications, launch once.

1. Download the latest `VibeGo.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Open it and drag **vibego** into Applications.
3. Launch it once. On first launch it wires up the Claude Code hooks for you automatically.
4. Start a new Claude Code session, the icon appears whenever Claude Code is running.

### Updating

Download the latest DMG and drag it into Applications (choose **Replace**). 
Launch it once, it refreshes its hooks on a version change, then restart Claude Code to pick them up.

### Option B — Claude Code plugin

Installs the hooks (status + open/close lifecycle) automatically from inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add woolson/VibeGo
/plugin install vibego@VibeGo
```

The plugin installs the hooks but not the app itself, so drag **vibego** into Applications once (from the DMG). The plugin launches it automatically on session start.

## How it works

The app is stateless. Claude Code hooks write the current status to `~/.claude/statusbar/state.json`; Codex hooks write to `~/.codex/statusbar/state.json`. The app polls both files every 0.4s and renders the most recently active agent's icon and label. Codex rate-limit data is read from the latest `token_count` event under `~/.codex/sessions/`, using the 300-minute primary window and 10080-minute secondary window.

The installer merges its hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` (backing it up first), and the app's only network call is a once-a-day GitHub release check ([details](docs/privacy.md)).

## Uninstall

```bash
node "/Applications/VibeGo.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.js"   # removes only our hooks
```
Then drag the app to the Trash.
