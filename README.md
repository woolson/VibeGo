## Claude Status Bar

A tiny macOS menu bar app that shows **Claude Code's live status**: an animated Claude icon while it's thinking or running a tool, a yellow dot when it's awaiting your permission, and the elapsed time of the current turn. Lightweight, no window, no dock icon, no usage dashboards.

_Built so you can tab away during a long "thinking" stretch and still see, at a glance, whether Claude is working, waiting on you, or done._

Signed and notarized. Open it, drag the app to Applications, launch once.

## What it shows

- **Thinking / working** — the icon animates, with a live `1m 1s` timer.
- **Running a tool** — a short label (`Editing`, `Reading`, `Running command`, `Using tool`, …).
- **Awaiting permission** — a paused yellow dot, in both the CLI and the Desktop app.
- **Idle / done** — rests on the Claude logo.

Everything is controlled from the menu:

- **Show timer:** toggle the elapsed `1m 1s` clock.
- **Play completion sound:** a soft chime when a turn longer than a minute finishes (off by default).
- **Animation style:**
  - **Claude**, the web "morph" spark
  - **Claude Code**, the terminal glyph spinner
  - **Crab Walking**, a pixel-art Clawd crab that scuttles while Claude works
- **Icon color:** **Orange** or **System** (adaptive black/white). The Claude and Claude Code styles follow this setting; Crab Walking is always its orange pixel-art self.
- **Version and update:** the menu shows your current version, with a one-click "Update available" when a newer release exists.

## Where it works

| Surface | Tracked? |
|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI (terminal) | ✅ |
| Claude Code Desktop — **Code** tab | ✅ |
| Cursor (Claude Code extension) | ✅ |
| Claude Desktop — **Chat** tab | ❌ |
| **Cowork** | ❌ |

### Awaiting-permission dot

🟡 As of 0.2.0 the yellow "Awaiting permission" dot fires in both the CLI and the Desktop app. It lights up the moment Claude is waiting for you to approve a tool, via Claude Code's `PermissionRequest` hook. (On auto, accept-edits, or bypass permission modes there are no prompts, so the dot never needs to show.)

## Requirements

- macOS 12+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (CLI or the Desktop app)
- Node.js (used by the hook scripts)

## Install

### Option A — DMG (recommended)

1. Download the latest `ClaudeStatusBar.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Open it and drag **Claude Status Bar** into Applications.
3. Launch it once. On first launch it wires up the Claude Code hooks for you automatically.
4. Start a new Claude Code session, the icon appears whenever Claude Code is running.

### Updating

Download the latest DMG and drag it into Applications (choose **Replace**). Launch it once, it refreshes its hooks on a version change, then restart Claude Code to pick them up.

### Option B — Claude Code plugin

Installs the hooks (status + open/close lifecycle) automatically from inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar
/plugin install claude-status-bar@claude-status-bar
```

The plugin installs the hooks but not the app itself, so drag **Claude Status Bar** into Applications once (from the DMG). The plugin launches it automatically on session start.

## How it works

The app is stateless. Claude Code hooks write the current status to `~/.claude/statusbar/state.json`; the app polls that file every 0.4s and renders the icon and label. `SessionStart` launches it; it self-quits once the Claude desktop app is closed and no Claude Code session is active (each active session is a file under `~/.claude/statusbar/sessions.d/`).

The installer merges its hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` (backing it up first), and the app's only network call is a once-a-day GitHub release check ([details](docs/privacy.md)).

## Uninstall

```bash
node "/Applications/ClaudeStatusBar.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.js"   # removes only our hooks
```
Then drag the app to the Trash.
