# Claude Status Bar

A tiny macOS menu bar app that shows **Claude Code's live status**: an animated Claude spark while it's thinking or running a tool, a yellow dot when it's awaiting your permission, and the elapsed time of the current turn. It sits next to your battery/clock and stays out of the way, no window, no dock icon, no usage dashboards.

> Built so you can tab away during a long "thinking" stretch and still see, at a glance, whether Claude is working, waiting on you, or done.

Signed and notarized. Open it, drag the app to Applications, launch once. See [Install](#install) for details.

## What it shows

- **Thinking / working** — the Claude spark animates, with a live `1m 1s` timer.
- **Running a tool** — a short label (`Editing`, `Reading`, `Running command`, `Using tool`, …).
- **Awaiting permission** — a paused yellow dot (CLI only, see below).
- **Idle / done** — rests on the Claude logo.

Two animation styles (pick in the menu): **Claude** (the web "morph" spark) and **Claude Code** (the terminal glyph spinner). Icon color can be **Orange** (Anthropic's `#d97757`) or **System** (adaptive black/white, like your other menu bar icons). The elapsed timer can be toggled off.

## Where it works

This is a **Claude Code** indicator, driven by Claude Code hooks. It tracks:

| Surface | Tracked? |
|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI (terminal) | ✅ |
| Claude Code Desktop — **Code** tab | ✅ |
| Claude Desktop — **Chat** tab | ❌ |
| **Cowork** | ❌ |
| IDE extensions (VS Code / JetBrains) | ❌ |

Chat and Cowork don't use Claude Code's hook system, so the status bar won't update while you're in those. It reflects Claude **Code** activity only.

### Permission detection is CLI-only

The yellow "Awaiting permission" dot appears when Claude Code fires its permission *notification*, which it does in the **CLI**. The **Desktop app** doesn't emit that hook for its in-app permission prompts, so the dot won't show there, the icon just stays on the current tool (e.g. "Writing") while the prompt is open. Everything else (thinking, tools, the open/close lifecycle) works the same in both. And if you run on **auto / bypass mode**, permission prompts never happen anyway, so this is a non-issue.

## Requirements

- macOS 12+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (CLI or the Desktop app)
- Node.js (used by the lightweight hook scripts)

## Install

### Option A — DMG (recommended)

1. Download the latest `ClaudeStatusBar.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Open it and drag **Claude Status Bar** into Applications.
3. Launch it once. On first launch it wires up the Claude Code hooks for you automatically. (Already had a previous version? You can skip this, just open Claude Code and it updates itself.)
4. Start a new Claude Code session, the spark appears whenever Claude Code is running.

> The DMG is signed and notarized, so it opens normally, no Gatekeeper warning, no right-click needed.

### Updating to a new version

1. Download the latest `ClaudeStatusBar.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Open it and drag **Claude Status Bar** into Applications. Finder will say an item with that name already exists and ask what to do, choose **Replace**. You do not need to uninstall the old version first.
3. Launch it once. On a version change it refreshes its hooks automatically and cleans up anything an older version left behind, so there's no manual step.
4. Restart Claude Code (or start a new session) so it picks up the refreshed hooks.

### Option B — Claude Code plugin

Installs the hooks (status + open/close lifecycle) automatically from inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar
/plugin install claude-status-bar@claude-status-bar
```

The plugin installs the hooks but not the app itself, so drag **Claude Status Bar** into Applications once (from the DMG). The plugin launches it automatically on session start.

### Using the Claude Code desktop app? Hide its built-in icon

The desktop app shows its own menu bar icon (the quick-screenshot one). To avoid two icons sitting side by side, open Claude's **Settings → General** and turn that built-in menu bar item off. Claude Status Bar then gives you a single, animated indicator.

## How it works

Claude Code fires hooks on its lifecycle events. Small scripts write the current status to `~/.claude/statusbar/state.json`; the menu bar app polls that file and renders the spark + label. Two `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` hooks launch the app when Claude Code opens and quit it when the **last** session closes (a session counter handles multiple windows).

The installer merges its hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` without touching your existing hooks, and backs the file up first (`settings.json.bak-statusbar`).

## Uninstall

```bash
node "/Applications/ClaudeStatusBar.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.js"   # removes only our hooks
```
Then drag the app to the Trash.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar
cd claude-status-bar
./build.sh            # builds build/ClaudeStatusBar.app
./build.sh --dmg      # also produces build/ClaudeStatusBar.dmg
```
Requires the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

## Troubleshooting

**The icon ran for a few seconds, then disappeared.** That's the app exiting on purpose, not a crash. It's a live indicator for Claude Code, so when no Claude session or desktop app is running it has nothing to show and exits cleanly. Run it with Claude Code open (or start a `claude` session) and it stays. You don't launch the app yourself; the session launches it.

**The icon doesn't appear at all.**
- Make sure a Claude session is actually running. Start a new session (or restart Claude Code) and the bar appears automatically.
- A session that was already running *before* you installed gets picked up once it does something, but starting a fresh session is the reliable way to bring the bar up the first time.
- Confirm it's running with `pgrep -x ClaudeStatusBar`: a number means it's running (it may just be hidden, see below); no output means it exited because no Claude session is active.
- If first-launch setup never took, run the installer manually: `node "/Applications/ClaudeStatusBar.app/Contents/Resources/install.js"`

**It's running but I can't see it.** On a Mac with a notch, a crowded menu bar can hide icons behind the notch. Remove some other menu bar items, or use a menu bar manager (Ice, Bartender), to reveal it.

**Uninstalling.** See [Uninstall](#uninstall) above. Dragging the app to the Trash alone leaves the hooks behind, so run the uninstall command first.
